# 4 Suppliers hold the version of record for their reutrns

## status
Accepted

## context

In handling support queries from suppliers trying to submit returns, we often identify small errors which are blocking a submission from succeeding, such as a space in an otherwise empty field or row, or a single value in a single cell in an otherwise empty row. 

The team handling support can often easily identify these issues and know how they could be rectified. However, doing so means the support team adopting some accountability for the content of the return as a whole, rather than all of that accountability remaining with suppliers. 

There is a subset of common errors which we correct in a consistent and programmatic way (removing hanging spaces, accepting N.A for N/A etc.). We consider this acceptable because we are applying the same rules to all returns, rather than making judgment calls on a per-return basis. 

We can post a visible list of the corrections we apply in this way to support auditing and transparency if needed. 

## decision

The Report MI team and those supporting the operation of the service will not make any changes to any content in a supplier's return file. 

Suppliers should be the only ones to make changes to the data they are returning to CCS about their business. 

This follows a principle of supporting and enforcing suppliers' accountability for submitting accurate returns, as outlined in **[link to PDR about no proxy returns]**


##consequences

operational, support and category teams need to be made aware of this decision and given appropriate guidance to implement it in their engagement with users and their response to user queries and returns in an error state. 

we should proactively tell suppliers with these sorts of issues why it is we need them to sort them out as part of our support and guidance in the service.
